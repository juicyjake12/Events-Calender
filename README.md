# Events-Calender

what i made in this module is a event planner to plan out your busy days. why i made this planner is to advance my knowledge into javascript by learning how to create timeblocks/columns only in javascript to create my timeblocks. how i built this project is i started from the left to right so i made divs and class rows for each element i was gonna have to use along with moment.js to build the time functions and query selectors for the timeblocks.
